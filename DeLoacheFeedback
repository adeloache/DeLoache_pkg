It looks like about half of the functions for this project are missing. I checked in your R folder, and there are two in there meeting the specifications of the assignment. There is some code in other places in this RStudio server, but for those functions to be picked up by your package and made available for your fellow students, they do need to be in the R folder, and crucially, they need to be documented in order to appear on your website and the help files for your package.
